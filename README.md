## üììProject description <a name="id3"></a>
Project in development that consists of a cocktail bar webpage. This website allows you to know how our drinks are made in case you have allergies or if you just want to be able to make them at home, here you can find all the ingredients.

This is a bar where you can dance, play board games, listen to music... We also have karaoke and open mic nights where you can get to know new talents. Your kids are more than welcomed here. We have cocktails without alcohol just for them.
